      <p>Child Health Days (CHDs) were introduced as a health-promoting strategy, initiated in Eastern and Southern Africa as an innovative way of delivering such a package free to all eligible children and their mothers. Reaching even the most under-served areas and targeting every child in a community, Child Health Days deliver cost-effective healthcare. As a ‘one stop shop’, children receive vitamin A supplements to boost immunity and prevent blindness; de-worming tablets to treat parasitic infections and the iron-deficiency anemia they can cause.</p>
